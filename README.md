<h1>I Wireframed/Designed and Develop A live prototype for Wix platform From scratch (Not Editor X)</h1>
<strong>
I have created 3 pages in <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/x6jSRH1ca7zfyblgqO34Eh/WIX?node-id=291%3A277" target="_blank">Figma</a>: 
</strong><br><br>

1. Storyboard - 
I researched and compared 4 successful website editors - Wix, Webflow, Elementor, and Editor X.

After analyzing the individual features of task part 1, I chose which individual features I prefer as a Customer, What I actually need and what I can clean and delete to concentrate on the art of web development & design.

The User flow I decided to concentrate on is:
Panel -> Media -> Gallery
 <br>
<br>

2. Wireframes -

I created a wireframe and put together a Figma prototype.

some concepts in my wireframe:
- Jakobâ€™s Law -  "The users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know."
-  Added A search field for Searching different widgets by voice.
- an AI Search to help the user generate various templates & components to save time, for example: "a call to action with an h1 and a button with the primary color." 
- to save screen size, I chose to make each step clickable and include breadcrumbs, so the user understands in which stage he is in.
And I changed the first panel to be general to have not many options to avoid confusion. 
- I chose in my toolbar to keep only these buttons, you can access the rest of the options if you close the editor and go back to Wix homepage.

Settings - to see more options
Theme editor - Design system manager
Layers navigator - to see the whole page and be able to drag and change the order in case the page is long it is helpful.

3. Prototype -

- I designed my wireframe, and improved it a bit.
  - in step number 2 and step number 3, you can drag the widget to the stage.
- after dragging an element to the stage a draggable window appear in the right side with more setting for each widget
